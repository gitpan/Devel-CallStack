2005-01-27  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Just minor documentation tweaks, no functional changes.
	
	* Release 0.19.

2004-12-19  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Undef (by localizing) $ENV{PERL5OPT} when running the tests.
	  [rt.cpan.org: Bug #8702 Devel::CallStack's tests fail when PERL5OPT is loading modules]
	  (affects especially CPANPLUS)
	
	* Add the "in" option.
	
	* Release 0.18.

2004-12-12  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Cleanup the tests and MANIFEST.

	* Give hints on how to proceed with the findings of Devel::CallStack
	  (section POSSIBILITIES).
	
	* Release 0.17.

2004-12-11  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Require 5.6.1 or newer, unfortunately.
	
	* Release 0.16.

2004-12-09  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Add the Append option.
	
	* Add set() and write() to allow partial profiling.
	
	* Test that callstack.out gets created even after bare 'use' -
	  and remember to remove it.
	
	* Release 0.15.

2004-11-29  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Broken permissions in CallStack.pm.
	
	* Release 0.14.

2004-11-29  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Make file_equal() use lc() in its testing so that places with
	  case-confused filenames can play, too.
	
	* Alias the Devel::CallStack variable names in to the DB package
	  for imaginary speedups.

	* Separate the $Full branch into its own for some tangible speedups.

	* One could get more speed by unrolling the $Full and $Reverse
	  but the code would become quite ugly, unmaintainable,
	  and error-prone for any future modifications.
	
	* Try to find and use the exactly same Perl that was used to run
	  the Makefile.PL (by looking at the generated Makefile).
	
	* Add the standard license.

	* Release 0.13.
