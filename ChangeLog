	* Make file_equal() use lc() in its testing so that places with
	  case-confused filenames can play, too.
	
	* Alias the Devel::CallStack variable names in to the DB package
	  for imaginary speedups.

	* Separate the $Full branch into its own for some tangible speedups.

	* One could get more speed by unrolling the $Full and $Reverse
	  but the code would become quite ugly, unmaintainable,
	  and error-prone for any future modifications.
	
	* Try to find and use the exactly same Perl that was used to run
	  the Makefile.PL (by looking at the generated Makefile).
	
	* Add the standard license.

	* Release 0.13.

	* Clean up and verbosify the tests.
	
	* Document the Jaguar problem.
	
	* Release 0.12.
